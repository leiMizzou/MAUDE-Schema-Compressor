Reporter Country Code	Denotes the country of the initial reporter (e.g., the user, caregiver, etc.).
PMA/PMN Number	Approved PMA or cleared 510(k), or premarket notification (PMN) number for the suspect device.
Exemption Number	Exemption/Variance Number used to identify MDR reports that are being submitted under the conditions of an exemption or variance granted by FDA under 21 CFR 803.19.
Number of Events Reported	Number of events that are described in the report.
Summary Report (Y/N)	Denotes whether the report summarizes multiple reports. Typically applies to reports submitted under an exemption or variance granted by FDA under 21 CFR 803.19, or a report received under FDA's Voluntary Malfunction Summary Report Program.
Report Source	Denotes whether this report was submitted by a Manufacturer, Distributor (Importer), User Facility, or Voluntary reporter.
Source Type	The source through which the manufacturer became aware of the reported adverse event.
Reporter Occupation	Denotes the initial reporter's occupation.
Remedial Action	Denotes whether a remedial action (e.g., a recall) was initiated.
Type of Report	Denotes whether the report is an initial report or a follow-up report. Note this field adds follow-up reports, also called supplement reports, as they are received, so readers can discern how many follow-up reports have been submitted. For example, a report with two follow-up reports will be denoted as "Initial, Follow-up, Follow-up."
Report Date	The date the report is submitted to FDA. If a follow-up report has been submitted, this field will display the date the most recent follow-up report was submitted. Note that if an initial reporter (e.g., an importer or user facility) also sent a report to FDA, this field may include that date in addition to the date the MDR reporter submitted to FDA.

PT HAD BEEN IN THE HOSP SINCE 9/95. PT FOUND AT APPROX 10:48 AM ON 11/14/95 TO BE DISCONNECTED FROM HIS VENTILATOR FOR AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN FOUND HE HAD CYANOSIS AROUND THE LIPS AND A RATE OF 54. PUPILS WERE APPROX 4 MM AND NOT FIXED AND DILATED. PT WAS RESUSCITATED AND EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN DEATH. ON 11/22/95 HE WAS DISCONNECTED FROM HIS VENTILATOR BY FAMILY DECISION AND EXPIRED AT APPROX 9:00 AM. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF EVENTS OF 11/14/95 RECONSTRUCTED AFTER STAFF INTERVIEWS: PT WAS IN BED POSITIONED IN THE "HIGH FOWLER'S" POSITION. APPARENTLY, THE BED ALARMS APPROX EVERY TEN MINUTES WHEN IN THIS POSITION. STAFF INTERVIEWED STATE THAT THIS BED ALARM IS EXTREMELY LOUD AND ANNOYING. AT SOME POINT DURING A BUSY SITUATION IN THE ICU, THE PT INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT BECAME DISCONNECTED FROM THE VENTILATOR. ESTIMATES HAVE RANGED FROM 1 TO 7 MINUTES BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE BED WAS ALARMING AND FROM CHART TIMES. THE RN WENT TO THE ROOM INVOLVED AND SHUT OFF THE BED ALARM. UPON DOING THIS, SHE THEN IMMEDIATELY HEARD THE VENTILATOR ALARM GOING OFF. ACCORDING TO HER, THE BED ALARM OBSCURED THE VENTILATOR ALARM. SHE IMMEDIATELY NOTED THE PT'S CONDITION AND AFTER MANUAL VENTILATIONS AND ATROPINE FAILED TO REVIVE HIM, A CODE WAS CALLED. A RHYTHM WAS OBTAINED AT APPROX 11:01 AM. ONE MAY NEVER KNOW HOW THE DISCONNECT OCCURRED AS THE PT WAS IMMOBILE DUE TO HIS MEDICAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO STAFF THERE HAD BEEN TWO PRIOR DISCONNECTS WITH THE SAME EQUIPMENT AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER DISCONNECT AFTER THIS EVENT. THE ADAPTOR, WHILE IT CONNECTS WELL WHEN PUT TOGETHER WITH TWO HANDS, SEEMS TO POP OFF WHEN USED ON A ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE WHERE CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT A BAND DEVICE OF SOME SORT SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO KEEP THE ADAPTOR AND TUBE TOGETHER HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. THE BED ALARM, WHILE SERVING ITS PURPOSE, WAS FELT TO BE EXCESSIVELY LOUD AND MASKED THE VENTILATOR ALARM. IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND THAT THE NOISE LEVEL IS ADJUSTABLE AND IT WAS ADJUSTED DOWN. }; { mdr_report_key: 29104, mdr_text_key: 19148357, text_type_code: D, patient_sequence_number: 1, date_report: None, foi_text: PHYSICIAN SHOCKED BY ELECTROSURGICAL PENCIL. }; { mdr_report_key: 29143, mdr_text_key: 17177348, text_type_code: D, patient_sequence_number: 1, date_report: None, foi_text: COMPLAINANT HAD A TOTAL OF 8 PEDICLE SCREWS IMPLANTED TO STABILIZE SPINAL COLUMN AFTER TRAUMATIC INJURY TO HER BACK FOLLOWING A SEVERE CAR ACCIDENT IN 2/94.

A RISE IN POWER CONSUMPTION BEGAN ON (B)(6) 2016 TO A PEAK OF 17.1 WATTS, OUTSIDE THE NORMAL OPERATING RANGE. WAVEFORMS OF THIS NATURE MAY BE INDICATIVE OF THROMBUS OR A CHANGE IN PATIENT STATE. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) STATES: THE LVAD SYSTEM IS INDICATED FOR USE AS A BRIDGE TO CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION IN PATIENTS WHO ARE AT RISK OF DEATH FROM REFRACTORY END-STAGE HEART FAILURE. IMPLANTATION OF A VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE (VAD) IS AN INVASIVE PROCEDURE REQUIRING GENERAL ANESTHESIA, A MEDIAN STERNOTOMY, A VENTILATOR AND CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS. THESE SURGICAL PROCEDURES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS RISKS AND ADVERSE EVENTS INCLUDING DEATH. AS STATED IN IFU, THAT RIGHT HEART FAILURE IS COMMON IN PATIENTS RECEIVING LVADS. ALSO THAT THE ETIOLOGY OF LATE RIGHT HEART FAILURE MAY BE A PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC HEART DISEASE. HVAD PUMP (B)(4) WAS NOT RETURNED TO HEARTWARE FOR EVALUATION. REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS CONFIRMED THAT THE ASSOCIATED DEVICE MET ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE. THE REPORTED EVENT WAS CONFIRMED VIA REVIEW OF THE CONTROLLER LOG FILES WHICH REVEALED THE REPORTED HIGH WATT ALARMS AND A RISE IN POWER CONSUMPTION TO PARAMETERS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL OPERATING RANGE. A REPORT PROVIDED BY THE SITE NOTED THAT A SIGNIFICANT 3RD HARMONY CONFIRMED THE SUSPECTED PUMP THROMBUS. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE DEVICE BY THE SITE REVEALED SCORING MARKS ON THE INFERIOR SURFACE OF THE IMPELLER AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OF THROMBUS ON THE IMPELLER AND INFLOW CANNULA. THESE FRICTION MARKS ARE INDICATIVE THAT AN EXTERNAL FACTOR SUCH AS THROMBUS MAY HAVE FORCED THE IMPELLER AGAINST THE REAR HOUSING WITH SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO OVERCOME THE REAR PRELOAD OF THE MAGNETIC SPRING/SUSPENSION SYSTEM. AS SUCH, THE PRESENCE OF FRICTION MARKS IS LIKELY A SYMPTOM OF THE CLINICAL CHALLENGE THE PUMP HAS EXPERIENCED AND IS GENERALLY NOT EVIDENCE OF A PUMP INDUCED PROBLEM. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT A DEVICE MALFUNCTION CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE HIGH POWER EVENT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS THROMBUS FORMATION. THE MANUFACTURER WILL SUBMIT A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WHEN NEW FACTS ARISE WHICH MATERIALLY ALTER INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN A PREVIOUS MDR REPORT. }; { mdr_report_key: 5866367, mdr_text_key: 51790839, text_type_code: D, patient_sequence_number: 1, date_report: None, foi_text: IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HIGH WATT ALARMS.
