## Overview

Maude Schema Compressor is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze, cluster, and optimize database schemas. It connects to a PostgreSQL database, extracts table structures and sample data, generates descriptive summaries, and clusters similar tables using K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. The tool further refines these clusters based on similarity scores obtained from the DeepSeek API, merges related tables, and provides detailed token count comparisons to assist in optimizing schema representations for various applications, including AI-driven analysis.

Additionally, the tool supports evaluation of clustering performance using various metrics, allowing users to assess the effectiveness of different clustering strategies and parameters.

## Usage

Since both the main analysis code and the evaluation code are placed inside `main.ipynb`, you can run the entire workflow through this Jupyter Notebook.

### Steps to Run the Analysis:

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Ensure that the `.env` file is properly configured with your database credentials, API keys, and other settings.

3. **Run the Notebook**

   Execute all cells in `main.ipynb` sequentially. The notebook is organized to perform the following steps:

   - **Data Extraction and Anonymization**: Connects to the database, extracts table structures and sample data, anonymizes sensitive information, and saves the data as JSON files in `OUTPUT_DIR`.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Generates table descriptions and extracts features using TF-IDF or SentenceTransformer embeddings.
   - **Clustering**: Performs clustering using K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN based on the configurations.
   - **Similarity Scoring and Merging**: Computes similarity scores using the DeepSeek API and merges clusters based on similarity thresholds.
   - **Evaluation**: Compares AI-generated groupings with manual groupings and calculates evaluation metrics (ARI, NMI, Precision, Recall, F1 Score).
   - **Merged Schema Generation**: Merges structures and samples of similar tables and saves them in `POST_MERGED_DIR`.
   - **Token Counting and Comparison**: Counts tokens before and after merging to assess the impact on schema representation size.
   - **Prompt Generation**: Generates prompt files before and after merging, integrating contextual information.
   - **Logging and Resume Capability**: Provides detailed logs and supports resuming from the last checkpoint.

### Note on API Usage

- Ensure that you have a valid **DeepSeek API Key** and that the API usage complies with your subscription limits.
- The script includes caching mechanisms to minimize redundant API calls.

## Evaluation

Maude Schema Compressor provides robust evaluation metrics to assess the quality and effectiveness of clustering results. It compares AI-generated groupings with manual (expert-based) groupings and calculates the following metrics:

- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Measures the similarity between two clusterings by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings.

- **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**: Evaluates the agreement between two clusterings by measuring the mutual information normalized against the average entropy of the clusterings.

- **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**: Assess the accuracy of the clustering by evaluating the correctness of group assignments in terms of true positives, false positives, and false negatives.

### How to Interpret Evaluation Metrics

- **ARI and NMI**: Higher values (closer to 1) indicate better agreement between AI-generated and manual groupings. Values near 0 suggest random labeling.

- **Precision and Recall**: Higher precision indicates fewer false positives, while higher recall indicates fewer false negatives.

- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate overall clustering accuracy.

### Viewing Evaluation Results

After running the analysis in `main.ipynb`, evaluation metrics are saved in the `evaluation_results.csv` file located in the project's root directory. You can open this file using any spreadsheet software or data analysis tool to review and interpret the results.

### Token Count Comparison

At the end of the analysis, the script outputs a comparison of token counts before and after merging, similar to the following:

```
=== Token Count Comparison ===
Total tokens in context.txt: 1500
Total tokens before merging (including context): 4500
Total tokens after merging (including context): 3000
Tokens from table descriptions before merging: 3000
Tokens from table descriptions after merging: 1500
Token reduction in table descriptions: 1500 tokens (50.00%)
```

This comparison helps assess the impact of merging on schema representation size, which is crucial for optimizing inputs for AI models with token limitations.
