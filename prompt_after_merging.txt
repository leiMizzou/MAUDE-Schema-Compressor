Reporter Country Code	Denotes the country of the initial reporter (e.g., the user, caregiver, etc.).
PMA/PMN Number	Approved PMA or cleared 510(k), or premarket notification (PMN) number for the suspect device.
Exemption Number	Exemption/Variance Number used to identify MDR reports that are being submitted under the conditions of an exemption or variance granted by FDA under 21 CFR 803.19.
Number of Events Reported	Number of events that are described in the report.
Summary Report (Y/N)	Denotes whether the report summarizes multiple reports. Typically applies to reports submitted under an exemption or variance granted by FDA under 21 CFR 803.19, or a report received under FDA's Voluntary Malfunction Summary Report Program.
Report Source	Denotes whether this report was submitted by a Manufacturer, Distributor (Importer), User Facility, or Voluntary reporter.
Source Type	The source through which the manufacturer became aware of the reported adverse event.
Reporter Occupation	Denotes the initial reporter's occupation.
Remedial Action	Denotes whether a remedial action (e.g., a recall) was initiated.
Type of Report	Denotes whether the report is an initial report or a follow-up report. Note this field adds follow-up reports, also called supplement reports, as they are received, so readers can discern how many follow-up reports have been submitted. For example, a report with two follow-up reports will be denoted as "Initial, Follow-up, Follow-up."
Report Date	The date the report is submitted to FDA. If a follow-up report has been submitted, this field will display the date the most recent follow-up report was submitted. Note that if an initial reporter (e.g., an importer or user facility) also sent a report to FDA, this field may include that date in addition to the date the MDR reporter submitted to FDA.

THIS MDR WAS ALSO NOT REPORTED WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME PERIOD. DEVICE DISCARDED-UNABLE TO FOLLOW-UP. THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SERVICE TECH (MES) REPLACED THE LOAD CELL AND CALIBRATED TO MANUFACTURING SPECS. THERE WERE NO RELATED CPF DEFECTS REPORTED ON THIS MACHINE. THE AFFECTED LOAD CELL ASSEMBLY WAS NOT RETURNED FOR AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE MES DISCARDED IT UPON REPLACEMENT. WITHOUT THE AFFECTED COMPONENT AN EVALUATION AS TO THE FAILURE MODE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. IF THE LOAD CELL WAS DEFECTIVE A LOAD CELL CIRCUIT ALARM WOULD BE GENERATED. THIS ALARM CONSISTS OF A STEADY AUDIBLE ALARM, THE TOTAL UF DISPLAY FLASHES, THE ULTRAFILTRATION CONTROL IS DISABLED, AND THE MACHINE ENTERS BY-PASS AS STATED IN THE DEVICE. IF THE MACHINE DOES NOT FIND A DEFECT IN THE LOAD CELL CIRCUIT THIS ALARM WILL NOT BE GENERATED. HOWEVER, ANY FLUCUATIONS IN THE LOAD CELL DURING A TREATMENT WILL BE NOTICED IN THE UF RATE. HOWEVER, ANY FLUCUATIONS IN THE LOAD CELL DURING A TREATMENT WILL BE NOTICED IN THE UF RATE. IF THE LOAD CELL STOPPED READING AT A CERTAIN POINT THE UF CIRCUIT WOULD TRY TO COMPENSATE AND THE UF RATE WOULD INCREASE.
